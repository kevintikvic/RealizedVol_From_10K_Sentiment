   ITEM 1   
   
  BUSINESS  
   
 Barrel Energy Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 27, 2014. We were formed to engage in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in North America. 
   
 Barrel Energy Inc. is an oil and gas company with a focus on assets located in North America. Currently the company holds oil   gas leases in Alberta, Canada and its current strategy is to develop its oil   gas leases beginning with a geological assessment to determine the economic potential of the oil   gas leases. The company currently holds interest in 2,560 acres of oil   gas leases known as the Bison Property. Our near-term business strategy is to conduct preliminary exploration activities on the Bison Property as laid out in more detail in the  Description of Property  section with the end goal being to achieve positive results during our exploration activities, our goal is to develop the Bison Property to commercial production and achieve positive cash flow taking into account economic considerations such as the recent downturn in the oil   gas sector.  
   
 The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land totaling (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west. It is one of only a few large-scale tectonic elements in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that has significantly disturbed the Phanerozoic cover of the craton. The structure has influenced the location of oil and gas accumulations in strata ranging from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Cretaceous, and has long been a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in the region.  
   
 The Peace River Arch has already established facilities for natural gas gathering and compression facilities that can be accessed based on Barrel Energy s needs. Although the Peach River Arch region boasts well established infrastructure weather conditions do play a role in our ability to access the Bison property. For instance, the need to helicopter in equipment and or human resources may arise based on location or weather conditions. 
   
   Geology:   
   
 The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west. Sediments shed from the Arch, during deposition were deposited in abundance in braided channels, fluvial stream channels and shallow marine environments, which created numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area. Sediments were thickest adjacent to the emergent Arch with sands in of up to 180 feet in total thickness deposited in the braided channel systems coming off the structural highland. Thicknesses decreased to the east away from the source rock ultimately terminating some 75 miles east from the PRA. The Gilwood member at Bison shows approximately 7 feet of gas pay over water in the Gilwood formation and was perforated between 1,468.5m and 1,470.5m. (4,818-4,825 feet)

Table of Contents      
   
   Land tenure:   
   
 The Bison leases were acquired through a private oil   gas company with an effective date of September 1, 2014. A total of 4 oil   gas leases located in Alberta, Canada were acquired totaling 2,520 acres, as follows:  
  
    There is one well on the property, Invasion ELM Bison 10-15-95-15WSM. UWI 102/10-15-095-15W5/00. Currently the well is shut-in.   Disclosure of Oil and Gas Operations: 
  The Company reviewed the status of its asset which is an unimproved oil property under lease. From this review the Company determined it does not have the adequate resources combined with the present market price of oil to develop it into a producing property. As of September 30, 2017, the Company elected to impair the asset and reduce its value to zero. The Company had impairment expense of $45,042 and $0 for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
   
   Reserves:   
   
 The Company did not have any reserves at September 30, 2017. Accordingly, you may not reasonably assume that the Company has any reserves on its leases. 
   
   Production:   
   
 The Company has not had production from inception (January 27, 2014) through September 30, 2017. Following is a table showing production data from inception (January 27, 2014) through September 30, 2017:

   Undeveloped Acreage as at September 30, 2017:   
   
 As of September 30, 2017, Barrel holds a total of 2,560 total gross undeveloped acres that it acquired in September, 2014. This acreage relates to the Bison leases described above. 
   
   Drilling Activity:   
   
 The Company acquired these properties in September, 2014. The Company has not yet done any drilling on the leases. 
   
   Present Activities:   
   
 There are no present wells being drilled. As of the date of this report, Barrel management is not planning its initial exploration activities at the property. 
   
   Delivery Commitments:   
   
 The Company does not have any delivery commitments or any short or long term contractual obligations. 
   
   Marketing:   
   
 We currently do not conduct any marketing activities. We do not believe that any marketing activities will be necessary to conduct operations following on any of the properties described above. Lone Pine is currently the operation of the Bison property and will be responsible for the marketing. Should we take on the operatorship of the property then on the responsibilities would be the marketing of the oil   gas products. At this time, we have no plans for becoming an operator. 
   
  COMPETITION  
   
 Given the highly competitive nature of the oil   gas sector and our company being a new exploration stage company we face competition from numerous competitors within in the industry. We compete with junior and senior oil and gas companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire oil and gas properties throughout North America. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas interests is strong with many oil and gas leases available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the financial and technological information or expertise to compete with all competitors. 
   
 Our competitor oil and gas companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of oil and gas properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. These competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring oil and gas interests of merit or on exploring or developing their oil and gas properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire oil and gas properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. The potential for this competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further oil and gas interests or explore and develop our current or future oil and gas properties. 
   
 In addition, we compete with other junior oil and gas companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in companies such as ours, and this may limit our ability to raise future capital. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior oil and gas companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, helicopters, float planes, oil and gas exploration supplies and drill rigs.

  SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS  DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR SUPPLIERS  
   
 There are numerous providers of geological and exploration services in Alberta, such as seismic and drilling. We will not be dependent on one or a few suppliers. 
   
  PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS  
   
 We do not have any proprietary products. We currently have no patents or trademarks for our company name or brand name 
   
  NEED FOR ANY GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS  
   
 Not applicable. 
   
  GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION  
   
 We will be subject to applicable laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including United States securities laws. We will also be subject to regulation by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). We will be required to apply to the AER to obtain drilling permits for wells on our Bison leases. 
   
  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES  
   
 Other than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. We do not currently plan to spend any funds on research and development activities in the future. 
   
  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS  
   
 The oil and natural gas industry is subject to provincial and federal environmental regulations. Such legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on the release or emission of various substances produced in association with certain oil and natural gas operations. In addition, such legislation requires that well and facility sites are abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. Compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures and breach of such requirements may result in the suspension or revocation of necessary licenses and authorizations, civil liability for pollution damage, and the imposition of material fines and penalties. 
   
 Our operations are subject to numerous laws relating to environmental protection. These laws impose substantial penalties for any pollution resulting from our operations. We believe that our operations substantially comply with applicable environmental laws. The main governing body, Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans. In 2013 the AER became a new organization and began taking on regulatory functions related to energy development that were previously held by Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRD). The and the AER is the single regulator of energy development in Alberta from application and exploration, construction and development, to abandonment, reclamation, and remediation. 
   
  EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS  
   
 We currently have two employees. Gurminder Sangha acts as our Chief Executive Officer and Jurgen Wolf as our Chief Financial Officer. We do not have any employment agreements.

  Preferred Stock  
   
 Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Preferred Stock ). The Company has not yet issued any of its preferred stock.  
   
  Dividends  
   
 We have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of dividends in the future will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our then board of directors. It is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
   
  Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans  
   
 The Company does not have any equity compensation plans or any individual compensation arrangements with respect to its common stock or preferred stock. The issuance of any of our common or preferred stock is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, which has the power to issue any or all of our authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. 
   
 The Company s Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued Common Stock without stockholder approval. The Company currently has no commitments to issue any shares of common stock. However, the Company will, in all likelihood, issue a substantial number of additional shares in connection with a business combination. Since the Company expects to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with a business combination, existing stockholders of the Company may experience substantial dilution in their shares. However, it is impossible to predict whether a business combination will ultimately result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the target has a relatively weak balance sheet, a business combination may result in significant dilution. If a target has a relatively strong balance sheet, there may be little or no dilution.

 We were organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 
   
 We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders or other investors. 
   
 We believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholder plus the placement of common stock for cash. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

   Item 9A (T): Controls and Procedures.   
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 For purposes of this section, the term  disclosure controls and procedures  mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Act ) (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below. 
   
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
   
 Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and thus, are not effective as of September 30, 2017. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The material weaknesses relate to the following: 

- 
 Lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and primarily all accounting functions are performed by our Chief Executive Officer. Our President does not possess accounting expertise.  

- 
 Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review, as all accounting and financial reporting functions are performed by our Chief Financial Officer and the work is not reviewed by anyone.  

- 
 Lack of Audit Committee, independent directors and financial experts  

- 
 Lack of effective control instituted over financial disclosures and report process    
   
 These weaknesses are due to the company s lack of working capital to hire additional staff. To remedy the material weaknesses, we intend to engage another accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. 
   
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to the attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
   
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  
   
 The Company has not yet made any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
   
   Item 9B: Other Information

PRESENT     
   
 In February, 2014 the Company issued a total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Gurminder Sangha for cash at $0.001 per share for a total of $10,000. 

Conflict of Interest  
   
 The Officer and Directors of the Company will devote time to the Company however; there will be occasions when the time requirements of the Company s business conflict with the demands of their other business and investment activities. Such conflicts may require that the Company attempt to employ additional personnel. There is no assurance that the services of such persons will be available or that they can be obtained upon terms favorable to the Company. 
   
 There is no procedure in place which would allow the Officer and Director to resolve potential conflicts in an arms-length fashion. Accordingly, they will be required to use their discretion to resolve them in a manner which they consider appropriate. 
   
 The Company s Officer and Directors may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of a portion of his common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed merger or acquisition transaction. It is anticipated that a substantial premium over the initial cost of such shares may be paid by the purchaser in conjunction with any sale of shares by the Company s Officer and Directors which is made as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed merger or acquisition transaction. The fact that a substantial premium may be paid to the Company s Officer and Directors to acquire his shares creates a potential conflict of interest for him, in satisfying his fiduciary duties to the Company and its other shareholders. Even though such a sale could result in a substantial profit to them, they would be legally required to make the decision based upon the best interests of the Company and the Company s other shareholders, rather than their own personal pecuniary benefit. 
   
  Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act   
   
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors and officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the Company s securities with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
   
 Based solely on the Company s review of the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that no person who, at any time during such fiscal year, was a director, officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Company s common stock failed to comply with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during such fiscal years. 
   
  Code of Ethics   
   
 We have not adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions in that our sole officer and director serve in these capacities. 
   
  Nominating Committee   
   
 There is no nominating committee.  
   
  Audit Committee   
   
 There is no audit committee.  

Item 11: Executive Compensation.   
   
 Currently, our officers and directors are serving without compensation. They are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses that he incurs on our behalf. In the future, we may approve payment of salaries for officers and directors, but currently, no such plans have been approved. We also do not currently have any benefits, such as health or life insurance, available to our employees.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
   
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Barrel Energy, Inc. 
 Surrey, British Columbia, Canada 
   
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Barrel Energy, Inc. (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders  equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
   
 We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
   
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barrel Energy, Inc. as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Barrel Energy, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered losses from operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

  NOTES     TO     FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  
   
  NOTE     1   NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
 Barrel Energy Inc ( Barrel , the  Company ) was incorporated on January 27, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company was formed to invest in producing oil and gas properties. On September 26, 2014, the Company leased an unproven oil and gas property in the province of Alberta, Canada. 
   
  NOTE 2   ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Accounting Method  
   
 The Company s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
   
 The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on September 30. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
   
  Oil and Gas Property  
   
 The Company is in the process of exploring its unproved oil and natural gas properties and has not yet determined whether these properties contain reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of amounts shown for oil and natural gas properties is dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, confirmation of the Company s interest in the underlying oil and gas leases, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete their exploration and development and future profitable production or sufficient proceeds from the disposition thereof. The Company is, therefore, unable to estimate when these costs will be included in the amortization computation. 
   
 The Company uses the successful efforts method in accounting for it oil and gas properties. 
   
 Unproven oil and natural gas properties are reviewed on an annual basis for impairment. As of September 30, 2017, the Company elected to impair the asset and reduce its value to zero. The Company had impairment expense of $45,042 and $0 for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
   
  Property   and equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs associated with repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

  Foreign currency translation  
   
 The Company s functional currency is in Canadian Dollars (CAD) dollars and reporting currency is in U.S. dollars. The financial statements of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52,   Foreign Currency Translation  . Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
   
  Impairment of Long-lived Assets  
   
 The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is estimated based upon either discounted cash flow analysis or estimated salvage value. See Footnote 6. 
   
  Estimates and Assumptions  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The Company s significant estimates include the fair value of common stock issued for services. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. 
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board) Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting  for Income Taxes . It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a result, the Company has applied a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. The guidance only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the various taxing authorities. 
   
 The Company classifies penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statements of Operations and comprehensive loss.

  Basic and diluted net loss per share    
   
 Basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share calculations include the dilutive effect of common stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share is the same due to the absence of common stock equivalents. 
   
  Reclassification  
   
 Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

 Because the Company has been recently reorganized and has not yet transacted any business, the new accounting standards have no significant impact on the financial statements and related disclosures. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances. 
   
  Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees and consultants in accordance with FASB ASC 718. Stock-based compensation to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using the Black Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants and the closing price of the Company s common stock for common share issuances. 
   
  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company, as shown in the accompanying balance sheets, has total assets of $250,160 in cash and an accumulated deficit of $178,477 as of September 30, 2017, compared to an accumulated deficit of $107,372 as of September 30, 2016. The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will engage in very limited activities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
